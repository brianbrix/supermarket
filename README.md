## KenSuper â€“ Minimal Kenyan Supermarket Front-end

A lightweight demo supermarket UI built with React + Vite. Focused on simplicity and local (Kenyan) context: staple products, KES currency formatting, and a very small feature set.

### Features
- Product listing (static sample data: unga, sukuma wiki, maziwa, mandazi)
- Search by name/description + category + price range filter
- Add to cart, adjust quantity, remove, clear (with toast notifications)
- Multi-step checkout: details â†’ simulated M-Pesa/Airtel payment â†’ confirmation
- Kenyan phone number validation & inline form errors
- Optional query param `?returnTo=checkout` (add item then auto-navigate to checkout)
- Cart summary with KES formatting
- Simple routing: Home / Products / Cart / About / Checkout
  - State persisted to localStorage (cart + theme)
  - Checkout progress persisted in sessionStorage (resume if you refresh)
  - Visual step indicator for checkout progress
  - Per-field (on-blur) validation feedback
  - Order confirmation: download text + PDF export + mock email trigger
  - Dark mode toggle (respects system preference + persisted)
  - Service abstraction layer (`orderService.js`) for payment + email mocks (future API hook)

### Tech
- React 19
- Vite 7
- React Router DOM 6
- jsPDF (PDF export)
- Context API (Cart / Toast / Theme)

### Architecture & Services
`orderService.js` encapsulates order-related async operations (currently mocked):
- `generateOrderRef()` â€“ deterministic per-session order reference
- `initiatePayment({ method, amount })` â€“ simulates mobile money payment (returns `paymentRef`)
- `sendEmailMock(order)` â€“ placeholder for future email integration

Themes handled via `ThemeContext`:
- Persists selection to `localStorage`
- Applies `data-theme` attribute on `<html>` for CSS variable switching
- Defaults to system `prefers-color-scheme` on first load

### Prerequisites
Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+ (Vite 7 & some deps require modern Node). If you see engine warnings or startup errors on Node 16/18, upgrade using nvm:
```
nvm install 22
nvm use 22
```

### Run Dev Server
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
Visit the printed local URL (default http://localhost:5173 ).

### Build & Preview
```
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Structure
```
src/
  components/ (Navbar, Footer, ProductCard, ProgressSteps)
  pages/ (Home, Products, Cart, About, Checkout)
  context/ (CartContext, ToastContext, ThemeContext)
  services/ (orderService.js)
  data/ (products.js)
  utils/ (currency.js)
```

### Future Ideas
- Real backend / API integration (replace service mocks)
- Authentication & real payment integration
- Real product images
- Inventory & stock levels
- Order history & user accounts
- Comprehensive unit & accessibility tests
- PWA offline cart support

### Notes
Cart data is client-side only (localStorage). Replace sample data with live API when ready.

## Backend Integration (Extended)

The frontend now integrates with a Spring Boot backend providing real products, categories, orders and admin utilities.

### Product Search Endpoint
`GET /api/products/search`

Query params (all optional):
- `q` â€“ free text (name/description partial, case-insensitive)
- `categoryId` â€“ numeric category id
- `minPrice`, `maxPrice` â€“ inclusive bounds
- `inStock` â€“ set to `true` to restrict to products with stock > 0

Example:
```
/api/products/search?q=milk&minPrice=100&maxPrice=500&inStock=true
```

### Stock Handling
- Each product has an integer `stock`.
- Orders atomically decrement stock; insufficient stock rejects the order.
- UI shows badges (Out / N left) and disables add-to-cart at zero.
- Cart quantities clamp to available stock and warn via toast if exceeded.

### Admin (Demo, Unsecured)
Routes under `/api/admin` allow product CRUD, order listing & status updates, category CRUD, and dashboard stats. In production these must be secured (JWT/session, role checks) and possibly separated into public vs admin category endpoints.

### Image Upload
`POST /api/products/{id}/image` multipart field `file` â€“ updates product `imageUrl` served from `/images/*`.

### Categories
Fetched from `GET /api/admin/categories` (public for demo). Each item: `{ id, name }`.

### New Frontend Admin Screens
- `/admin/products` â€“ search, create/edit (with stock & optional image), delete.
- `/admin/orders` â€“ list orders and update status via dropdown.

### Debounced Filtering UI
The home page now uses debounced queries for text (500ms) and range/stock/category filters, calling the backend search endpoint instead of filtering client-side.

> NOTE: Ensure environment variable `VITE_API_BASE_URL` points to the backend origin (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/api`).
